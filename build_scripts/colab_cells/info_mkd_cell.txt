# Colab ONLY!
❗ This notebook is designed to run on Google Colab.   
🎉 These top few cells should install the nescessary libraries needed and set you up to be able to run the rest of the notebook!

You should already have a Google account ready to go!

To bore you with details, these cells will:
- Install needed packages which are not already installed Google Colab
- Download the required data and extract it where it is needed

### 🧙‍♀️ Wizards
🧙‍♂️ If you're a wizard, here's some info about colab you may want to know:
- Each Colab notebook runs on its own temporary Linux virtual machine with its own filesystem.   
- If your notebook is shutdown, this will delete the temporary instance - this is why you need to mount Google Drive
- Colab seems to let you have about 3 notebook instances running at any time; each of these will be on their own unique VM
