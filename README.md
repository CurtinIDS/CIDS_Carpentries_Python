# CIDS_Carpentries_Python
Curtin Institute for Data Science adaptation of the Software Carpentries Python lesson.

The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task: data analysis.

## Scenario
Our imaginary colleague “Dr. Maverick” has invented a new miracle drug that promises to cure arthritis inflammation flare-ups after only 3 weeks since initially taking the medication! Naturally, we wish to see the clinical trial data, and after months of asking for the data they have finally provided us with a CSV spreadsheet containing the clinical trial data.

The CSV file contains the number of inflammation flare-ups per day for the 60 patients in the initial clinical trial, with the trial lasting 40 days. Each row corresponds to a patient, and each column corresponds to a day in the trial. Once a patient has their first inflammation flare-up they take the medication and wait a few weeks for it to take effect and reduce flare-ups.

To see how effective the treatment is we would like to:

Calculate the average inflammation per day across all patients.
Plot the result to discuss and share with colleagues.
